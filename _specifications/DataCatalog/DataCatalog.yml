  description: Media type, typically MIME format (see <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA

    In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding'
    can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information.
    Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate
    URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry.
