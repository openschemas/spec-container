# Description 
A Record acts itself as a dataset although it refers to what could be seen as the minimum compact, complete and auto-descriptive unit in a dataset, i.e., a record.

In Life Sciences, records will represent a BioChemEntity. A link to the represented physical entity should be done via “represents” property.
