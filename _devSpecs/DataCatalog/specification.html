    In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding'
    can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information.
    Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate
    URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry.

  sdo_desc: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind
    of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, such as ISBNs,

    notes</a> for more details.
