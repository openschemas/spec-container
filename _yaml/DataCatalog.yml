  description: Media type, typically MIME format (see <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA
    site</a>) of the content e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary.
    In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding'
    can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information.
    Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate
    URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry.

  description: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind
    of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, such as ISBNs,
    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See <a href="http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background
    notes</a> for more details.
